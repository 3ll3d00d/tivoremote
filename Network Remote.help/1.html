<h2>Quick Start</h2>

<p>By default, the TiVo's network remote service is disabled. To enable it, 
go into the "Messages and Settings" menu, then "Settings", "Remote, 
CableCARD, & Devices", and finally "Network Remote Control", and check 
"Enabled".</p>

<p>If the Network Remote Control is working properly, you should within a 
few seconds of starting it see a list of available TiVos from which to 
select, if any were found, along with a box to enter the address manually, 
in case it wasn't autodetected.</p>

<p>Zeroconf-based autodetection needs to send and recieve UDP on port 5353. 
Old-style autodetection sends and recieves TCP and UDP on port 2190, and 
recieves TCP on a randomly-chosen port. The core remote functionality 
will work as long as it can make outgoing TCP connections to port 31339.</p>
