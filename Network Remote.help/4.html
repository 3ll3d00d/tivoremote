<h2>Text Entry</h2>

<p>For the TiVo's on-screen keyboards, instead of moving the cursor around 
manually to select each letter, you can type your text here, and the 
program will enter it for you. The typical case now is to use the TiVo's 
new direct text entry method, which is selected by setting "Cols:" to 
zero (the default). This now works on the Series 3, HD and Premiere, and 
even works in HME apps if they've been updated to support it.</p>

<p>For apps that still require the old method, set "Cols:" to the number of 
columns in the keyboard, and ensure that the selector is on 'A' when you 
start sending the text. If these aren't set correctly, the results are 
unpredicatble.</p>

<p>The new method should be used when possible, since it's faster and 
reduces the risk of arrowing into the wrong place. Where it's not 
supported, only spaces and numbers will come through in this mode.</p>
