<h2>Buttons</h2>

<p>The function of most buttons should be obvious, but a few may need 
explanation:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Zoom</dt>
<dd>Also known as "Aspect" or "Window" on pre-Premiere remotes; they all 
use the same code.</dd>

<dt>Aspect</dt>
<dd>This displays a menu that lets you send discrete codes to select each
mode. It's the only way to access the TiVo's hidden stretch mode, and it's
useful in HME apps that do video streaming, but don't act on the Zoom
IRCODE.</dd>

<dt>CC</dt>
<dd>Closed-caption menu; now uses discrete commands for this purpose
instead of the Info-Down-etc. sequence used in older versions.</dd>

<dt>Clock</dt>
<dd>Sends Select-Play-Select-9-Select, to toggle the on-screen clock.</dd>

<dt>Skip</dt>
<dd>Also known as "Advance" and "the button with an arrow pointing to a 
line". This is your 30-second skip/slip or catch-up button, also used to 
enter the dash for OTA channels.</dd>

<dt>A/B/C/D</dt>
<dd>The multicolored buttons found on the latest TiVo remotes.</dd>

<dt>Kbd</dt>
<dd>Sends the text in the "Text:" window (see below). Note that you can 
just hit "Enter" on your keyboard when the text field is in focus to 
accomplish the same thing (not to be confused with "Enter" on the 
remote).</dd>

<dt>Standby</dt>
<dd>Puts the TiVo into standby mode, or pulls it out of it (into LiveTV) 
if it already was. This function is available as a discrete remote code 
for universal remotes, but isn't on the standard peanuts.</dd>

<dt>Quit</dt>
<dd>Exits the remote program; doesn't send anything to the TiVo.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Clock should be used only when playing back a recording. Otherwise, the 
results are unpredictable.</p>
